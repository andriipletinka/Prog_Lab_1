Module for creating a HTML map with 3 layers.
First layer is a map itslef.
Second layer are the 10 markers with closest filming locations from file locations.list from user input cordinates.
Third layer are the 10 markers with farest filming locations from file locations.list from user input cordinates.
The map shows us markers of closest and farest filming locations from user cordinates.

The first argument is a year of films' release, the second is a user latitude, the third is a user longitude and the fourth is a path to file.

As the result we get a HTML map named Map_1.html.
